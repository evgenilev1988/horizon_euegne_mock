#What’s your proudest achievement? Why are you proud of it? (It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally.)
There are several achievements that I am proud of but I’d like to highlight one in particular, during my work in PokerStars, the business introduced the idea of adding more interactive experience to the user. This was a widget that interactively being updated based on the user’s game playing. The design was a bit complicated because we needed to use an external library (Material UI) for developing this feature. In the beginning things did not do as planned because of the addition UI, but after several iterations, I presented this widget to the business. Their reaction was everything because they saw their idea becoming a reality, which is exactly why I love the front-end development. Seeing the reaction of the users after I deliver them new features.

#How would you notify yourself of errors in code you wrote that is shipped to production?
Production errors are important and because it somehow problematic to catch issue in production, there is a tool named Grafana. This tool provides enough information about the production site which can assist us to resolve any production issue

#Describe the advantages and disadvantages of React.
React as a JavaScript library has its advantages and disadvantages.
Here are several things that make it so great: 
*	React by being a library means that the developer essentially still writes JavaScript without the need of them to learn a new language or a framework like Angular.
*	React is based on components, which allows to develop small chunks of code for a specific purpose which describes what should be rendered to the screen and it becomes easier to maintain each component separately
*	In react because the DOM is virtual is allows SSR, which allows us to improve the website performance
Here are several things that react is not so great in:
*	One of React advantages can become its disadvantage, because it is a JavaScript library after all, it might prevent the developer to keep up to date with the technology
*	React components are using JSX, which includes HTML and JavaScript together, this might also introduce a learning curve for new users/developers.

Under what conditions would you use a singleton in JavaScript?
Singleton by definition is only one instance during the lifetime of the application, this definition can assist us to understand how global variables work. In my opinion, if we have global variables that we want to be used throughout the application lifecycle, a singleton is a good idea to use because then we do not create global variables which essentially will be hard to manage but if there is one place to store all these variables, Singleton is a good place to store/create them.
